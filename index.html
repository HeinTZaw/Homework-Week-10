                    Our everyday life depends on reliable and affordable energy. Yet energy is the contributing factor 
                    to climate change, accounting for <span class="important">60</span> percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions.

                    The United Nations has established a goal of Ensuring universal access to affordable electricity
                    by <span class="Year">2030</span>, emphasising that to reach the goal requires investing in sustainable global energy.

                    The following data visualisation explores possible contributing factors of global energy and

    <p class="parallel-paragraph_2"> The cholorpleth map show the percentage of countries 
        getting access to electricity . 
        This data set is more important for the developing countries because getting access to electricity also means those countries will use other alternatives such as fuel and coal for cooking. This does not also produce pollution to the society but also raise a lot of health issues , such as <span class="important">cancer</span> . According to National Institues of Government , household coal use was found to be associated with lung cancer risk among all studies throughout the world.

        Globally,  the production of renewable energy is increasing. That means United nation's goal to universal access to clean energy has foreseen the goal. 
The stacked area chart expresses global renewable energy production from <span class="Year">2000</span> to <span class="Year">2020</span>, which is increasing over the time.<br><br>
The hydro generation takes up majority of the production and still increasing. 
Wind energy has started to increase from <span class="Year">2005</span> and is increasing over the year.<br><br>
Minor energy production goes to geo biomass production. This is because biomass energy requires arable land to develop.This means that land used for biofuel crops such as corn and soybeans are unavailable to grow food or provide natural habitats. Therefore, if forested areas are not sustainably cut, re-planted, and given time to grow and sequester carbon, the advantages of using the wood for fuel are not offset by the treesâ€™ regrowth.

            From this article, it is concluded that <span class="important">GDP</span> has no huge dominance over the <span class="important">CO2 </span> of a country. Furthermore, the observed trajectory in energy production suggests that we are making significant strides towards achieving the <span class="UnitedNations">United Nation</span> 's sustainable energy goals. As the data stands, it is safe to conclude that we are well on our way to realizing these vital objectives.".
